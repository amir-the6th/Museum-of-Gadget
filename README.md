# Museum-of-Gadget - Responsive Bootstrap Website
A simple responsive website, powered by **Bootstrap**, **jQuery**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. 

The purpose of building this project was to expand my knowledge of using CSS and design a website with Bootstrap which does not resemble the default Bootstrap template.
